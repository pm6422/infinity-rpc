# LUI️✘

LUI️✘ is pronounced [ˈluːɪks], which is a RPC(Remote Procedure Call) and service governance framework, it can make calls between services more simple.

## Requirements

Before you can build this project, you must install JDK 8 on your machine:

You can install JDK by [SDK Man](https://sdkman.io/install).

```
sdk install java 8.0.312-zulu
```

Docker is optional, unit testing programs can start dockerized mongo, zookeeper instance.

[Docker Installation Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)

## Build

Run the following command to build the project:

```
./mvnw clean verify
```

### Building for production

To build the final jar and optimize the luix application for production, run:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
```

## Run

Run Luix Demo Server
```
java -jar luix-demo/luix-demo-server/target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:6010](http://localhost:6010) in your browser.

Run Luix Demo Client

```
java -jar luix-demo/luix-demo-client/target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:6020](http://localhost:6020) in your browser.

Run Luix Web Center

```
java -jar luix-web-center/target/*.jar
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:6030](http://localhost:6030) in your browser.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
./mvnw verify
```

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off authentication in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner) or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your LUI️✘ development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a mongodb database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/mongodb.yml down
```

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
