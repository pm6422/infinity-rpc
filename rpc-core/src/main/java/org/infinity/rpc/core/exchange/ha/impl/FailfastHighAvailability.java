 * Fail-fast fault tolerance high availability mechanism

 * so that the system can be pre-configured in accordance with the process execution error,
 * the corresponding mode is "fault-tolerant (fault tolerance)"
 * With JAVA collection fast failure, for example,
 * when multiple threads are operating on the same set of content, it may generate fail-fast event.
 * For example: When a thread A iterator to traverse through a collection process,
 * the content if the set is changed by the other thread;
 * then thread A collection of access,
 * ConcurrentModificationException will throw an exception (error found a good set execution error process),
 * resulting in fail-fast event.
