```

[[run-demo-sample]]
== Run multiple applications locally in two steps
=== 1. Build application docker images
* Run the command under the project root directory
```bash
npm run docker:build
```
* Or run the below command if using ARM CPU
```bash
npm run docker:build:arm64
```

=== 2. Run all the middleware and applications
* Run authorization server, resource server, client, and initialize database in one command
```bash
npm run all:up
```

== Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off authentication in [docker/sonar.yml](docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner[sonar-scanner] or by using the maven plugin.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```
